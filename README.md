# CI/CD WITH GITHUB ACTIONS

Final project for the EATI2023 DEVOPS course: YOUR CI/CD PIPELINE WITH GITHUB ACTIONS.

## DevOps

**DevOps** is a software development methodology that combines the work of development and operations teams to improve software efficiency and quality. The main goal of DevOps is to automate the process of software development, integration, and delivery. This is achieved by implementing tools and practices that allow development and operations teams to work together more effectively.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a DevOps practice used to regularly integrate developers' code into a shared repository. This means that every time a change is made to the code, tests are run to ensure that all the code works correctly when the components act together.

**Continuous Delivery (CD)** is the next step after continuous integration. Once the code has passed integration testing, its delivery to the production environment is automated. This means that any changes in the code can be implemented quickly and efficiently, reducing the wait time between code writing and delivery to the end user.

## About the project

The project has a *main.py* file whose task is to create a file in order to successfully pass the tests implemented in *test.py*.
The *pipeline.yml* file located in _eati2023-DevOps-Pipeline/.github/workflows/_ implements a Github Actions workflow **Pipeline Workflow** following the following *Pipeline DevOps*:
